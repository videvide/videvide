### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- To become a better software developer, Iâ€™m building [hohle.art](https://hohle.art) â€” an online art platformâ€”are you hiring?
- **Fun fact:** I started coding because I wanted to build somethingâ€”turns out, I also had to learn *everything* else. ðŸ˜„
- I'm also diving into low-level topics like the kernel, networking, and security.
