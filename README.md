### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m currently working on [hohle.art](https://hohle.art) â€” an online art platform.
- To become a better software engineer, Iâ€™m learning how to build and ship an enterprise project from my living roomâ€”are you hiring? My toolbox includes:
  **Linux, Caddy/Gunicorn/Express, Docker, Django/Python, RR7/TypeScript, GraphQL (Strawberry/urql/graffle), Tailwind, MyPy, GraphQL Codegen, Vite, Vitest, Pytest, Remix/React Hook Form, Git, Bash, GitLab/GitHub, AWS, and my trusty home lab stocked with ramen and tea to keep everything running smoothly.**
- **Fun fact:** I started coding because I wanted to build somethingâ€”turns out, I also had to learn *everything* else. ðŸ˜„
- I'm also diving into low-level topics like the kernel, networking, and securityâ€”especially malware analysis and exploits.
