# Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [hohle.art](https://hohle.art) â€” an online platform where artists and collectors meet (pre-alpha launching soon!).  
- ðŸŒ± To become a better software engineer, Iâ€™m learning how to build and ship an enterprise project from my living roomâ€”are you hiring? My toolbox includes:  
  **Linux, Caddy/Gunicorn/Express, Docker, Django/Python, RR7/TypeScript, GraphQL (Strawberry/urql/graffle), Tailwind, MyPy, GraphQL Codegen, Vite, Vitest, Pytest, Remix/React Hook Form, Git, Bash, GitLab/GitHub, AWS, and my wonderful home lab.**  
- **âš¡ Fun fact:** I started coding because I wanted to build somethingâ€”turns out, I also had to learn *everything* else. ðŸ˜„
